- 👋 Hi, I’m aCIDman, or Cid for short.
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting friends who want to design video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about video game design and programming while in school for Comp Sci
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video game projects of various kinds using C++ for the code, programming with SFML for 2D, and OpenGL for 3D (eventually Vulkan) art with blender for 3D, and gimp for 2D, all to coallesce into a small Pi device I want to construct as a big gameboy with a touch screen, except instead of first gen pokemon looking games, on my brick will be full featured 3D games made in Vulkan
- 📫 How to reach me jhardee@augusta.edu
